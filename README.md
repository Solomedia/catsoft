## Base Folder Structure

```

├── README.md
├── components

```

Routing in Next.js is based on the file system, so `./pages/index.js` maps to the `/` route and
`./pages/about.js` would map to `/about`.

The `./static` directory maps to `/static` in the server, so you can put all your
other static resources like images or compiled CSS in there.

## Install dependencies

### `yarn`

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm run dev` || `yarn dev`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any errors in the console.

### `npm run build` || `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `.next` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

### `npm run start` || `yarn start`

Starts the application in production mode.
The application should be compiled with \`next build\` first.
